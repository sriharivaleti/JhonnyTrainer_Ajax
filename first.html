<!-- Explanation
Once the document loaded then immediately we will be able to see one button Change Content , and see i have been given onclick=”fun1()” [ line number 33 ] means once we click on this button controller will go to line number 4 and will starts execute that fun1()
At line number 6, i have taken one variable with name a
For any ajax program, we must create one request object to send our ajax request to the server, that ajax object is nothing but XMLHttpRequest object
See line number 8,  i have written window.XMLHttpRequest means am checking whether my browser supports XMLHttpRequest object or not, if yes assigning XMLHttpRequest object into a [ a=new XMLHttpRequest(); ] else i mean if our web browser doesnt supports XMLHttpRequest object then we can assign ActiveXObject   [ which supports old web browsers ] into our variable a [  a=new ActiveXObject(“Microsoft.XMLHTTP”); ]
So from line numbers 8 -15 request object creation work been done
Now controller directly jumps to line number 25,  and opens the connection and send the request to java4s.txt (this is my notepad file), see actually the 3rd parameter i have given as true means Asynchronous data transfer will be activated
Finally request will be sent in line number 26, that’s it.
If server sends the response back to our application then controller will automatically execute from line number 17 – 23, you may get one doubt like why its not executed initially… ? there is a reason actually this a.onreadystatechange=function() executes only when we get the response from the server, hope you are clear ;)
